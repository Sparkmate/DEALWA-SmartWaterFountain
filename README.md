Organizational structure, try think of it in terms of (static) components, where their firmware never changes (pump, heater, etc.), and your mother (dynamic) component, where the firmware is dynamically changing/OTA whatever. Have your folder structure reflect this --> it'll be easier to read, debug, and also easier to handle OTA updates eventually.
