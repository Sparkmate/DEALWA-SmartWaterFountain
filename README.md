# [Dealwa](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dealwa/?originalSubdomain=fr) Smart Water Fountain example project, made during the Sparkathon #1 session.

## Summary

- This example project shows the basic structre on how to build a smart water fountain with optional functions and features.
- Our hope with this project is to show you how with just a few simple components you can make real-world products that help real people!
- We hope to evolve this code over time, so check back in future to see how it evolves!

## Capabilities/Limitations

- Currently this code simply takes a button press and with that opens a relay that in turn powers a water valve.
- There is a framework ready for optional payment methods, a display, and WiFi connectivity to an app, but none of these are in place.

## Project ownership

- All code within this project is owned by Dealwa
- Code in this project was created by [Matt@Sparkmate](matthew@sparkmate.co) for the Sparkathon #1 day, a free one-day event where Sparkmate helps impactful startups solve real problems.
